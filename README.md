# HSSPM

HSSPM is a light-weighted data management system designed specifically for clinical and lab research.

## Features
* Simple and straight-forward. Short learning curve
* Specifically designed for translational research to monitor subject recruitment, sample stocks and transfer history, and research projects
* Pre-degigned with four portals: sample stock portal, clinical data portal, project portal, and administration portal. Each portal has its own interface tailored to meet the different needs of wet lab researchers, clinical research assistants, lab project managers, and administrators.
* Group-based user access control. Protect sensitive data from the public and lower rank users.
* Especially considered IRB requirements, only a specific group of people (e.g. clinical RA, PI) can view sensitive data via clinical data portal.  Other portals only show basic de-identified info
* Flexible demographic data structure in clinical data portal. Can be used to store any type of demographic data, idenfiable or de-identified data.
* Secure. Proteced by passwords. And reCAPCHA is inplemented to prevent spam and abuse.
* No messup. Changes to data are recorded: who, when, which data, and what changed.
